# impact-cratering

Materials put together to support bits of the Europlanet workshop "Rocks from Space and Planetary Defence" - https://eventi.unibo.it/epn24-moroccoworkshop/

The repo is designed to point readers/participants to the workshop to data-focused recources related to planetary (and somewhat terrestrial) impact cratering. There is no aim of completeness. 

If you discover any mistake, or inaccuracy, please reach out, or open an issue.
